multi_fasta
===========

The goal of the project is to create a simple structure to read fasta files
in different programming language.

The sample test file comes from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format#Header_line

It is basically a play-ground for me nicely replacing the traditionnal HelloWorld
example used to test programming languages.
